         <p>On 26 November 2021,</p>
         <p>WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern,</p>
         <p> named Omicron, on the advice of </p>
         <p>WHOâ€™s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).  This</p>

         <p>on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.</p>
